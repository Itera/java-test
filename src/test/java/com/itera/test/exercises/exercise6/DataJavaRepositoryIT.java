// We need to extend for spring
// We need to mark it as a JPA test

    // Inject the repository you want to test - mark it as Autowired

    // Create a test that uses the injected repository's findAll method
    // Run some assertions - for example:
    // - assert that the size is correct
    // Use any of the assertion libraries we have already seen
